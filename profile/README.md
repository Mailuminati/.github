# Mailuminati

**Mailuminati** builds open and collaborative tools for the email ecosystem.

Our focus is on spam detection, phishing mitigation, abuse handling, and
large scale email security, with an emphasis on practical engineering,
performance, and shared intelligence.

Mailuminati projects are open to **anyone operating email services**,
from large providers to small operators, community infrastructures,
associations, and independent administrators.

## What We Do

Mailuminati develops tools and systems designed for real world email
infrastructure:

- Mail service providers of any size  
- Self hosted and community run mail systems  
- Associations and non profit infrastructures  
- Abuse desks and trust & safety teams  
- Anti spam and anti phishing engineers  
- Researchers working on email threats and deliverability  

Our projects are built to operate close to MTAs and filtering engines,
under real constraints on latency, CPU usage, and storage.

## Core Principles

### Pragmatic Engineering
We prioritize solutions that can be deployed in production,
on real mail flows, without unrealistic resource requirements.

### Privacy by Design
Mailuminati tools avoid raw email sharing and personal data exchange.
Detection relies on structural signals, proximity, and aggregate intelligence.

### Collaborative Defense
Spam and phishing are industrialized.
Defense must be collective.

Mailuminati promotes shared threat intelligence without centralizing
content, ownership, or control.

### Transparency
Most of our work is open source, documented, and designed to be inspected,
audited, and improved by the community.

## Projects

Some of the projects hosted under the Mailuminati organization include:

- **Mailuminati Custos**  
  A distributed and collaborative email threat detection system based on
  structural fingerprinting, locality sensitive hashing, and remote confirmation.

- **Mailuminati Oracle**  
  A shared decision engine that validates proximity signals and maintains
  threat clusters derived from community feedback.

- Tooling and integrations for MTAs, filtering engines, and abuse workflows.

Each repository documents its own scope, architecture, and deployment model.

## Who This Is For

Mailuminati is intended for anyone who operates, maintains, or secures
email services, including:

- Large and small email providers  
- Independent mail server operators  
- Community and associative infrastructures  
- Hosting providers  
- Security researchers and practitioners  

If you run mail infrastructure and care about abuse, these tools are for you.

## Open Source and Licensing

Unless stated otherwise, Mailuminati projects are released under permissive
open source licenses.

See individual repositories for license details.

---

## Get Involved

Contributions, feedback, and experimentation are welcome.

You can:
- Explore the repositories
- Open issues with real world use cases
- Propose improvements or new ideas
- Share operational feedback from production environments

Mail defense works best when knowledge and signals are shared.

## Philosophy

Email remains one of the most critical and most abused communication systems.

Mailuminati exists to help anyone operating mail services defend it
collectively, pragmatically, and at scale.
